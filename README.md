# AGE-DETECTION-FOR-HORROR-ROLLER-COASTER
# TASK 3
Age Detection for Horror Roller Coaster:
Description:
In this task, you will develop a machine learning model for real-time age detection on a horror roller coaster.
The model should detect the age and gender of people.
If the age is less than 13 or greater than 60, the model should display a message saying, “Not allowed” and mark them with a red rectangle. 
Additionally, the model should store all data, including age, gender, and entry time, in an Excel or CSV file.
Guidelines:
Create your own machine learning model for this task.
While a graphical user interface (GUI) is not mandatory, you are welcome to include one if you wish. 
Although accuracy is important, we will evaluate your work based on the overall performance of your model and the successful functionality of your GUI.
